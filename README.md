# K-Nearest-Neighbours-Implementation-in-Python
 This project is the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm in Python
 ## Project Includes
 1. KNN.ipynb python 3 notebook containing the code
 2. data.mat file containing a 50x3072 array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 32x32 colour image. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values, the next 1024 are green, and the final
1024 are blue. The image is stored in row-major order.
